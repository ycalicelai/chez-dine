			<li>
				<h4> Background</h4>
				<p>These terms of use (the “<strong>Terms</strong>” or “<strong>Terms of Use</strong>”) govern your access of the child care communication software,
				whether accessed: (a) on a computer connected to the internet at <u></u><a href="index.html"><i> www.chezdine.com </i></a></u> (the “<strong>Website</strong>”); (b) on <strong><i>Chez Dine </i></strong>
				social media properties; or (c) by mobile device (individually and collectively, (a), (b), and (c) are the “<strong>Product</strong>”),
				as owned and operated by <strong><i>Chez Dine</i></strong>, a company located at 3-231 Main St W, Hamilton, ON L8P 1J4 (referred to in these 
				Terms as “<strong>we</strong>”, “<strong>us</strong>” or the “<strong>Company</strong>”). These Terms govern the use of all persons using the Product, including without 
				limitation, the account manager or organization who registers an account on the Product (the “<strong>Account Manager</strong>”), 
				all additional managers, teachers and parents (collectively, along with the Account Manager, “<strong>You</strong>” or the “<strong>User</strong>”),
				who have registered for the use of the Product, and are binding on any use of the Product, and apply to You from the time 
				that You access the Product. For clarification, “You” includes terms such as “your” and “yourself”.  </p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h4>Approval of the terms</h4>
				<p>It is important that You read these Terms carefully. If You do not agree to these Terms, please do not use the Product or browse the Website. By accessing or using the Product,

				to time; and (c) You have read and understand our Privacy Policy, which can be accessed at <a href="index.html"><u><i>http://chezdine.com/</i></u></a> (the "<strong>Privacy Policy</strong>"), the terms of which are incorporated herein by
				reference, and agree to abide by the Privacy Policy. </p>			
				<br>
				<p>You may not use the Product nor accept these Terms if you are not of a legal age to form a binding contract with us. If You accept these Terms, You represent that You have the capacity to be bound by them, 
				or if You are acting on behalf of a company or entity, that You have the authority to bind such company or entity (and in which case “<strong>You</strong>” will refer to the company or entity).</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h4>Amendment</h4>
				<p>We may add to, discontinue or revise these Terms or any aspect, mode, design, or service provided under the Product, which include but are not limited to the:</p>
				<ol class="alphabetList" type="a">
					<li> scope of the features;</li>
					<li> timing of the features;</li>
					<li> software/hardware required for access to the Product; and</li>
					<li> geographic locations or jurisdictions in which certain features may be available.</li>
				</ol>
				<br>
				<p>We may amend the Terms without notice for non-material amendments. In the event of a material change, we will provide the Account Manager with thirty (30) days’ notice of a material change in the Terms and conditions 
				(including changes in pricing) via e-mail to the e-mail address supplied to us by the Account Manager, setting out: </p>
				<ol class="alphabetList" type="a">
					<li>the new or amended agreement terms;</li>
					<li>how such terms read formerly;</li>
					<li>the date of the coming into force of the amendment; </li>
					<li>the means in which You can respond and the effects of not responding; </li>
					<li>the option to either terminate the agreement or retain the existing agreement unchanged; and</li>
					<li>the language of this provision with reference to the applicable consumer protection legislation rules for amending these terms and making any additional requirements for amendments as prescribed by law (if any).</li>
				</ol>
				<br>
				<p>It is the Account Manager’s responsibility to send such notices of material changes to all Users associated with the Account Manager’s account. We highly recommend that Users read any amendments carefully. Unless explicit 
				consent is required by the law, we have the right to assume that You have accepted the change to the terms and conditions, unless You notify us to the contrary, no later than thirty (30) days after the amendment comes into force, 
				that You desire to cancel the contract or deregister or unsubscribe from access to the Product.  </p>
				<br>
